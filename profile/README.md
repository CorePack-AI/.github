## 🔮 The Vision

**Intelligence should be installed, not just prompted.**

AI development today is stuck in the *Amnesic Era*.  
Every session resets. Every tool forgets. Every agent relearns the same truths.

I am building the **persistent memory layer for the AI age**.

CorePack AI turns *context* into a **transferable, versioned, and standardized asset**—just like code.  
Clone a repository, and you should clone the intelligence required to understand it.

---

## 🛑 The Problem: Amnesic Agents

- **Siloed Knowledge**  
  What you teach one AI tool never transfers to another.

- **Repetitive Prompting**  
  Developers waste hours re-explaining architecture, rules, and patterns.

- **Vendor Lock-in**  
  Memory lives in proprietary clouds, not in your codebase.

AI tools are powerful—but they have no long-term memory you control.

---

## ⚡ The Solution: Unified Context Protocol (UCP)

Standardization is the unlock.

Just as `package.json` standardized dependencies,  
the **Unified Context Protocol (UCP)** standardizes agentic context.

- **File-System Native**  
  Context lives inside your repo (`.ai/`), not in black-box servers.

- **Agent-Agnostic**  
  Works with any AI that can read files: Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, LangChain, etc.

- **Installable Intelligence**
  ```bash
  npx corepackai install @corepackai/ucp
  ```

## 🛠️ The CorePack Platform

### 1. The Registry
A marketplace for reusable context packs:

- **Frameworks**: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind  
- **Patterns**: Clean Architecture, Repository Pattern  
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Python, Rust

---

### 2. The CLI
Tooling for context lifecycle management.

```bash
# Install architectural context
npx corepackai install @patterns/clean-architecture

# Verify context integrity
npx corepackai doctor
```

---

### 3. The Community
An open space for builders exploring agentic memory,  
context systems, and human–AI collaboration.
