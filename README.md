## 🔮 The Vision

We believe that **Intelligence should be installed, not just prompted.**

Today, AI development is stuck in the "Amnesic Era." Every time you open ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor, you start from zero. You paste snippets, explain your architecture, and repeat your rules. When the chat ends, that knowledge evaporates.

**We are building the persistent memory layer for the AI age.**

Our mission is to turn "Context" into a transferable, versioned, and standardized asset—just like code. We envision a future where downloading a repository also downloads the *intelligence* needed to understand it.

---

## 🛑 The Problem: Amnesic Agents

- **Siloed Knowledge**: What you teach Claude doesn't transfer to Cursor. What you explain to Copilot is lost to Windsurf.
- **Repetitive Prompting**: Developers waste hours re-explaining typical patterns, tech stacks, and project rules.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Proprietary memory systems lock your data into their specific ecosystem.

## ⚡ The Solution: Universal Context Protocol (UCP)

Standardization is the answer. Just as [package.json](file:///c:/Users/Nikhil/Desktop/contextai/cli/package.json) standardized dependencies, the **Universal Context Protocol (UCP)** standardizes agentic memory.

- **File-System Based**: Context lives in your repo (`.ai/`), not in a black-box cloud.
- **Agent Agnostic**: Works with *any* AI tool that can read files—Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, LangChain, etc.
- **Installable**: `npx corepackai install @corepackai/ucp` instantly gives your agent architectural understanding.

## 🛠️ The CorePack Platform

We are building the ecosystem to support this standard:

### 1. The Registry
A centralized marketplace for Intelligence. Discover "Packs" for:
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind
- **Patterns**: Clean Architecture, Repository Pattern
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Rust, Python

### 2. The CLI
The toolchain for context management.
```bash
# Install architectural patterns instantly
npx corepackai install @patterns/clean-architecture

# Verify your context integrity
npx corepackai doctor
```

### 3. The Community
We are an open collective of "Context Engineers"—developers who specialize in codifying knowledge. We are defining the specs, building the packs, and creating the tools that bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution.

## 🤝 Join the Movement

We are looking for builders, thinkers, and early adopters to help define the standard.

- **[Read the Manifesto](https://corepackai.com/blog/manifesto)**: Understand the philosophy behind UCP.
- **[Explore the Docs](https://corepackai.com/docs)**: Learn how to build your first Context Pack.
- **[Join Discord](https://discord.gg/4eebttHFnm)**: Discuss specs, share packs, and meet the team.
